<h1>Course Project: iSong App</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z40-9jZLfIU)

<h2>Description</h2>
In this iSong App project, I collaborated as a frontend developer alongside a backend developer partner. This project involved the development of a music application using Java programming, incorporating elements such as algorithms, data structures, virtual machines, bash scripting, version control, and CSV file manipulation. The core functionality of the iSong app revolved around providing users with a dynamic platform to access and manage their music libraries. Users can input five command to perform actions including read csv file, retrieve song lists by range of danceability, filter songs by minimum energy, retrieve five fastest song from the list, and quit the program.

--- I mainly implemented rotate and test methods in BinarySearchTree, FrontendDeveloperTests, FrontendInterfaceImplement, IterableRedBlackTree, and RedBlackTree. Other are implemented by my backend partner and professor/TA
